# CONTENT_INDEX.md

## How To Use This File

Use this index to find the current role of each URL before editing. Update it whenever URLs, page roles, metadata, CTAs, schema, or internal-link responsibilities change.

## Page Inventory

The rows below are the primary-locale baseline. Localized versions keep the same
`translationKey`, use their configured locale prefix, and must appear in canonical,
hreflang, sitemap, and route-manifest validation.

| URL | File/Route | Type | Primary Keyword | Search Intent | Primary CTA | Internal-Link Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | `src/data/pages/home.ts` | Landing | Template Game guide | Find the best entry point | Open Wiki / Browse Guides | Hub | Replace with the configured game's main hub intent. |
| `/wiki` | `src/data/pages/wiki-pages.ts` | Guide | Template Game wiki | Understand confirmed facts | Guides / FAQ | Hub | Keep official fact base and source context here. |
| `/guides` | `src/data/pages/guide-pages.ts` | Guide | Template Game guides | Find guide topics before launch | Wiki / Release Info | Hub | Do not invent walkthroughs before reliable details exist. |
| `/release-date` | `src/data/pages/release-pages.ts` | Guide | Template Game release date | Check release timing and platforms | FAQ / Wiki | Supporting hub | Must stay tied to official or store sources. |
| `/faq` | `src/data/pages/site-pages.ts` | Guide | Template Game FAQ | Get short answers | Release Info / Contact | Answer hub | FAQ schema enabled. |
| `/about` | `src/data/pages/site-pages.ts` | Utility | about Template Game Guide | Trust and editorial policy | Contact | Trust | Explain unofficial status and sourcing rules. |
| `/contact` | `src/data/pages/site-pages.ts` | Utility | contact Template Game Guide | Corrections and source updates | About | Trust | Contact channel pending. |
| `/privacy-policy` | `src/data/pages/site-pages.ts` | Legal | privacy policy | Privacy and analytics | Terms | Trust | GA4 only when configured. |
| `/terms` | `src/data/pages/site-pages.ts` | Legal | terms of use | Site use expectations | Privacy Policy | Trust | Keep unofficial disclaimer clear. |

## Generated Route Families

- Fixed and tool pages: authored in `src/data/pages/*.ts` with explicit locale and final URL.
- Entity Hubs and details: generated from `src/data/entities.ts` and the generic renderer in `src/lib/entities.ts`.
- Final route inventory: `npm run routes:manifest`.
- Secondary-locale routes use the prefix configured in `src/data/site.ts`; the primary locale remains on root paths.

## Content Clusters

- Launch facts: `/release-date`, `/faq`
- Official facts and safe guide structure: `/wiki`, `/guides`
- Evergreen hub and trust: `/`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/privacy-policy`, `/terms`
